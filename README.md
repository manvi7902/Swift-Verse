Taylor Swift Lyrics Generation

This project involves the development of a deep learning model for song lyric generation using LSTM and NLP techniques. The model was trained on a large dataset of lyrics to learn patterns and relationships between words and sentences.

The language model was implemented using CuDNNLSTM, an optimized version of LSTM for NVIDIA GPUs, to accelerate the training process and improve performance. This helped to speed up the training process and increase the accuracy of the generated lyrics.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the model, examples of generated lyrics were provided and compared to real lyrics. These comparisons showed that the generated lyrics were comparable in quality to real lyrics, indicating the success of the project.

Overall, this project showcases the potential of deep learning and NLP techniques in generating creative content like song lyrics.
